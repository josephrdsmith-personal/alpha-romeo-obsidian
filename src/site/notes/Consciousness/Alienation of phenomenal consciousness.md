## Abstract

Illusionism is an eliminativist position about qualia stating that phenomenal consciousness is nothing more than an introspective illusion. The attention schema theory (AST) relates this philosophical stance to a large body of experimental data and states that phenomenal consciousness arises from an internal model of attention control. In this paper, I intend to show that AST and illusionism have significant implications both in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and in the explanation of Fermi paradox.

Firstly, on the basis of findings concerning the evolutionary history of phenomenal consciousness on Earth, I argue that extraterrestrial biological life is likely to experience phenomenality. In the second part, I set AST in the context of a post-biological universe, where artificial intelligence (AI) is the dominant form of intelligence. I argue that phenomenal consciousness is probably present in these entities, and that they could even be super-conscious. Finally, I show that because phenomenality grounds value, illusionism has profound revisionary consequences in the field of ethics. This reconsideration of the justifiability of our values paves the way to AI misalignment and may be the source of neocatastrophic scenarios that explain to Fermi paradox.

## 1. Introduction

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) has been the subject of an abundant literature. Stimulated by the regular discovery of Earth-like exoplanets, the subject remains particularly popular today. The striking discrepancy between on the one hand the lack of results from this endeavor and on the other the immensity of the Universe leads to the Fermi paradox (FP). This paradox, epitomized by the question "where is everybody ?", has been commented on in equal measure [[[1\|[1]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib1), [[2\|2]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib2), [[3\|3]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib3)]. Most of the existing academic corpus is the product of researchers in the natural sciences which is not surprising given the natural links between these issues and disciplines such as astronomy (exoplanet detection, radio astronomy), astrobiology (biogenesis, biochemistry) and astrophysics (stars and planets formation).

The search for ETI and the FP are also rich in philosophical implications which have not been neglected by scholars. As well as questioning our place in the Universe, these topics have given rise to reflections in various areas of philosophy. Philosophy of language has explored the problem of communication with an ETI, contributing to the birth of astrolinguistics and the development of the Lincos language. Its researchers have also discussed, among other things, the indeterminacy of translation and the non-universality of mathematical language [[4](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib4),[5](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib5)]. The obvious ethical implications of searching for extra-terrestrial life have also been widely debated [[6](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib6),[7](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib7)]. One of the explanations for the FP, the ”dark forest hypothesis” (the idea that ETI are silent for fear of being detected and destroyed by another hostile civilization), highlights what is at stake in this area of philosophy [[8](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib8)]. Other solutions to the paradox allow us to venture into the realms of epistemology and ontology, such as Bostrom's controversial “simulation hypothesis” [[2](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib2),[9](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib9)].

Philosophers of mind, who are fond of thought experiments involving hypothetical planets and alternative life forms (biological or artificial), have added their voice to the debate. Their contributions revolve around the question “how would intelligent aliens think ?” [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10)]. In my opinion, it is crucial to consider this issue before even contemplating the modalities and consequences of communication with an ETI. The particular aspect of whether or not this alien intelligence would have conscious experiences sounds particularly intriguing. Philosophy of mind has undergone new developments in recent decades, and new standpoints on consciousness have emerged.

One such view, illusionism, pioneered by Rey and Dennett in the 1980s, is an eliminativism about phenomenal consciousness (p-consciousness) [[11](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib11)]. Although illusionism is primarily a philosophical stance, its main thesis has been adopted by neuroscientific theories of consciousness such as the “attention schema theory” (AST) [[12](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib12),[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13)].

To my knowledge, the potential implications of the AST and illusionism in general for the FP and the search for ETI have not yet been studied. This is what I shall attempt to outline in this article.

## 2. Revealing the illusion

### 2.1. Illusionism in philosophy

It's not the purpose of this paper to thoroughly expound and defend illusionism. Therefore, I refer the reader to the works of some of its main proponents (such as Frankish [[14](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib14)] and Dennett [[15](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib15)]) and to the excellent introductory article of Leal-Toledo et al. [[16](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib16)]. A brief description of illusionism is nevertheless mandatory, as this theory forms the starting point of this article. Moreover, as it is a minority view, it's not as well-known as other theories of consciousness [[14](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib14),[17](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib17)].

Phenomenally conscious states are mental states that are said to possess qualitative properties (qualia), such as there is “something it is like” to be in those states. Typical examples include the visual sensation of “redness” of an evening sky, the pain of a headache, or the taste of an apple.

Physicalist theories of consciousness usually accept the reality of these states, despite acknowledging that their qualitative properties[1](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn1) are at odds with physicalism (the view that everything is physical). Then they try to explain how something purely physical, like the brain, can come to experience something as peculiar as phenomenal consciousness. This is the well-known “hard problem of consciousness” [[14](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib14),[16](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib16),[18](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib18)].

Conversely, the main tenet of illusionism is to deny the existence of phenomenally conscious states. For an illusionist there is “nothing it is like” to be in any mental state. Proponents of the theory only accept “quasi-phenomenal” states and properties, which are purely physical, but misrepresented as phenomenal by our introspective mechanisms. Illusionists are physicalists who take a different approach by being eliminativist about qualia and p-consciousness in general. In a nutshell, p-consciousness is nothing more than an introspective illusion, a magic trick played by the brain on itself. Since p-consciousness doesn't exist as such, the “hard problem of consciousness” disappears [[11](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib11),[14](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib14),[18](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib18)].

While it is no longer a question of understanding the magic itself, we still have to explain how it happens. The “hard problem” has been replaced by the “illusion problem”. It consists in explaining why it seems to us that we are phenomenally conscious (how does the illusion work ?), but also why we are so strongly convinced of it (why is the illusion so strong ?). The latter part of the problem has been referred as the “illusion meta-problem”) [[11](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib11),[14](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib14),[17](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib17),[18](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib18)].

Different responses to this “illusion (meta)-problem” have been proposed, and as stated by Kammerer, three main approaches dominate the literature. The illusion has been considered as the consequence of “hard-wired features of our introspective mechanisms” (notably by Graziano, Humphrey and Pereboom), of “a mistaken inferential mechanism of projection” (by Rey) or of “a mix of features of our introspective mechanisms and of [Cartesian] philosophical prejudices” (by Dennett) [[17](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib17),[18](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib18)].

A defense of illusionism would be much longer than a description of it,[2](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn2) as it is a highly counter-intuitive theory. However, I totally support the idea that “illusionism is, most likely, the best candidate for the standard theory of consciousness” [[16](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib16)].

To simplify the construction of sentences, in the rest of this article I will use expressions such as "to possess p-consciousness” or "to have a subjective experience”. These are to be understood respectively in the sense of "claiming to possess p-consciousness” and "having the illusion of subjective experience”. Also, mainly to remain in line with existing work, I will continue to speak of "phenomenality”, although the term "quasi-phenomenality” should be used.

### 2.2. The attention schema theory

It's time to introduce the “attention schema theory” which I regard as a very convincing response to the illusion (meta-)problem. Once again, in order to limit the length of the paper, I advise the reader to consult Graziano's primary work for a detailed account of the theory [[12](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib12),[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13),[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)]. Because it's an illusionist theory, the AST doesn't explain how an information processing machine like the brain can “generate a feeling of consciousness”, but how it can come to “make the claim that it has a subjective experience” and “cannot make the difference” [[20](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib20)]. According to the AST, the answer is that “[phenomenal] consciousness is an internal model of attention” [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)].

Attention is defined as the mechanism for selecting between internal and external signals that compete for the brain's limited processing resources. It enables the brain to allocate its resources to signals that are useful to the individual at the time. These selected and reinforced signals have a greater impact on decision-making and behavior [[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13),[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)].

In order to efficiently control attention, the brain automatically builds a model (the “attention schema”) which represents attention in a simplified and imperfect way. Thanks to this simplicity, the model can be computed rapidly and constantly updated with a minimum energy [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)]. This schema consists of a simple relation of awareness between a model of the self and a piece of information (for instance the model of an apple, including visual inputs that selected by the attentional process) [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)].

Higher cognition has access to the attention schema but not to the whole complex underlying process of signal selection and enhancement. So, sticking with this example, the only information that can be known by introspection is that there is a subject (the model of the self) who has a subjective awareness, an experience, of the model of an apple [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19),[21](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib21)]. All in all, the brain renders this information (of itself to itself) as a subjective phenomenal experience. What is usually called a phenomenal state is nothing more than a relation of awareness represented by the attention schema [[18](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib18),[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)].

Since this process is purely automatic and beyond the reach of higher cognition, there is no way (and no reason) to doubt its outcome [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)]. This explains both the origin and the force of the illusion, resolving the illusion (meta-)problem.

The “body schema”, a widely recognized concept developed several decades ago, is a didactic analogy. It's a brain internal control model sharing the same characteristics as the attention schema. The body schema is a clearly simplified representation of the body (lacking physical details such as bone structure and muscle attachment points), but fairly accurate since it allows us to move our body quickly and accurately most of the time [[12](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib12),[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13),[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19),[22](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib22)]. Higher cognition can partly access to this model and derive explicit knowledge from it (we can, for example, verbalize the position of our arm). However, there is a loss of information because there is no way of obtaining the signals arising from each muscle fiber [[12](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib12),[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13)].

It should be noted that focusing solely on the subject would make this presentation of the theory incomplete. There is indeed a social dimension to the AST. It's because we are able to attribute awareness to ourselves that we are able to attribute awareness (and incidentally emotions, motivations and intentions) to others [[21](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib21)]. To continue the analogy with the body schema, it is because we are able to create a model of our own body that we can model the body of others [[12](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib12),[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13)].

AST is supported by a convincing amount of experimental data: humans and animal behavioral evidences, brain imaging and computational modeling [[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13)].

The close correlation between reportable consciousness (awareness) and attention has been supported by a great variety of studies [[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13)]. Both attention and awareness are target-directed, selective, graded, operate over the same information domains and impact behavior [[22](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib22)]. Furthermore, attention and consciousness usually covary [[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13),[22](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib22)], as awareness is a fairly accurate model of attention [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)]. Despite all the similarities, attention and awareness are not the same thing. Because the model is not perfect, many studies show that the two can be dissociated [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19),[22](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib22)].

Brain imaging and brain lesions support the idea of an interweaving of the neural networks supporting the control of attention, the modeling of one's own attention and the modeling of other's attention. One region in particular, the temporo-parietal junction seems to play a fundamental role, and damage to this region results in spatial hemi-negligence (impairment of the conscious experience of everything on the affected side of space, while stimuli can still be processed unconsciously and influence behavior) [[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13),[20](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib20)].

Finally, according to the AST, the control of attention should be impaired in the absence of an attention schema. This prediction was tested using artificial neural network models trained to engage spatial attention. Only when given an attention schema could the networks successfully control attention [[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib13),[20](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib20)].

Finally, it has to be stated that the AST do not stand in isolation. It has gained the overall assent of prominent illusionist philosophers such as Dennett and Frankish [[23](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib23),[24](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib24)].[3](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn3) It also relates to other prominent theories of consciousness such as the global workspace theory and the higher-order thought theory. It can be understood “as a specific unification” of these two theories [[22](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib22)].

More generally, as the reader will have inferred from the above description, the AST is based on a computationalist conception of the mind, in which the mind is seen as an information-processing system. Computationalism is mainstream in cognitive sciences but do not enjoy universal acceptance [[25](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib25),[26](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib26)]. Furthermore, the AST naturally leans towards functionalism, as it has no prerequisites regarding the hardware required for computation. Within the computational theory of mind, functionalism about consciousness states that it is necessary and sufficient for a system to be conscious that it performs a certain type of computation [[26](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib26)].

## 3. Illusion and biological evolution

### 3.1. Evolution of p-consciousness on earth

According to illusionism, p-consciousness is an introspective illusion resulting from mechanisms hard-wired into our brains that misrepresent brain physical states into phenomenal states. The AST characterizes these mechanisms as an internal model for controlling attention leading the brain to claim it's having a subjective experience.

Whether or not we accept these assertions, it is clear (given all the neural correlates of consciousness described by neuroscience) that p-consciousness is rooted in neural networks that have emerged in the course of our evolutionary history. Before considering p-consciousness elsewhere in the Universe, it is important above all to understand how and why it appeared on Earth.

Graziano has already placed the AST within an evolutionary framework. He noted that the earliest neural networks were undifferentiated and incapable of selective signal enhancement (attention) [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19)]. Phylogenetic reasoning suggests that this ability appeared at the time of the Cambrian explosion, since it's present in clades sharing a common ancestor which lived at that time. Initially bottom-up, the attention process gained a top-down component over the next 200 Ma. Attention is actually known to have this complexity in birds and mammals, whose common ancestor lived around 350 Ma ago [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19),[21](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib21)]. The social dimension of the attention schema probably appeared at the same time, but clearly developed 65 Ma ago with the evolution of primates [[19](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib19),[21](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib21)].

This evolutionary history shows that p-consciousness most certainly comes by degrees. Moreover, we can suspect that, to a certain extent, it is much more widespread among living things than is generally admitted. Potential cases of convergent evolution could even broaden the spectrum of species endowed with some degree of phenomenal experience (the disputed case of cephalopods, whose last common ancestor with mammals lived more than 750 Ma ago, is a good example) [[27](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib27)].

But ultimately, what could be the advantage of p-consciousness ? As Gutfreund notes, all that matters from an adaptative point of view is behavior. An antelope escaping from a lion has to run quickly and efficiently, and doesn't need “the terrible feeling of fear” to do so [[28](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib28)]. Indeed, any fitness-enhancing behavior can be conceived without involving p-consciousness [[28](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib28)]. I'm not just talking about simplistic knee-jerk reactions. I have no problem with the idea that a "philosophical zombie” that exhibits complex unconscious behavior could survive and thrive in the wild.

The adaptive value of consciousness lies not in the feeling but almost certainly in the mechanism for controlling the attention that produces it. Attention is an adaptative response to the constraint of limited information processing capacities. The attention schema is a further step in optimizing the use of the brain's resources to cope even better with this constraint. If we take the example of the antelope and the lion, the attention schema enables the antelope to prioritize the processing of the signals that are important for its survival (such as the lion's visual signals in its field of vision). Performing this task quickly and efficiently increases the chances of the antelope not being eaten.

But the most striking advantage of the attention schema in organisms with complex brains resides in its social dimension. Because the antelope is able to model its own attention and that of others, it can take into account the worried looks of fellow antelopes who have spotted a predator and even interpret the predator's intentions. This ability to cooperate and to attribute intentions certainly has some great adaptative value. I'm not saying that a philosophical zombie couldn't have brain circuits resulting in the same behavior, but an internal model of attention might be much more flexible and economical. All in all, the terrible feeling of fear is not necessary in itself but is a by-product of a useful mechanism.

### 3.2. Organic extra-terrestrial life and phenomenality

The integration of p-consciousness into the evolution of life on Earth has strong implications for the search of ETI, because we have strong reasons to believe that extraterrestrial organic life is also shaped by evolution [[[29\|[29]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib29), [[30\|30]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib30), [[31\|31]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib31), [[32\|32]](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib32)]. In particular, it most likely undergoes natural selection (which includes adaptation), although some other aspects of the modern synthesis of evolution theory may not be fully transposable [[29](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib29),[30](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib30)].

In the same way that eye-like organs have evolved independently multiple times on Earth as an adaptation to a similar environment [[29](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib29)], I also posit that, by convergent evolution, p-consciousness has every chance of emerging elsewhere in the Universe.[4](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn4) Any living organism that processes information is necessarily constrained by the limits of its computing capacity. The most obvious adaptive response to this constraint is to select and prioritize the signals to be processed by means of an attention mechanism. Once an organism's information processing system reaches a sufficient degree of complexity, the benefits of an internal control model of attention are conceivably almost as great as those of an eye-like organ in a lighted environment.[5](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn5) Thus, accepting both the AST and the universality of natural selection, we can assume that any organic ETI, necessarily endowed with a complex information-processing system, will probably possess a model of attention control and will experience phenomenality.

Nevertheless, since p-consciousness is gradual, the subjective experience of an ETI could differ qualitatively from our own. To get an idea of what this potential difference might be, we need only remember that throughout our lives we have phenomenal experiences that diverge from our ordinary waking state. The phenomenal experience we had as infants before acquiring language, dreaming, taking hallucinogenic drugs or deep meditation are just a few examples.

Considering that ETI will experience phenomenality is of interest for the CETI branch of the SETI program (communication with ETI). Phenomenality provides indeed a common ground between us and ETIs, as well as a basis for empathy (beneficial to both participants in the communication process).

I'm perfectly aware that this association between intelligence, complex organic information processing systems and p-consciousness may seem problematic at first sight. In fact, some authors have argued that intelligence does not require consciousness and I totally support this claim [[33](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib33)]. It's not antithetical because it depends on how intelligence is defined.

Because it's a non-binary, gradual and multidimensional concept, there are dozens of definitions of intelligence [[33](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib33),[34](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib34)]. In the broadest sense, intelligence is the ability to acquire, process and store information towards adaptative behaviors within an environment or context [[3](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib3),[33](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib33)]. Accepting this definition, even a bacterium such as _E. coli_ can individually express non-conscious intelligent behavior through chemotaxis [[33](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib33)]. Collectively, _E. coli_ bacteria have the ability to solve more complex problems such as route finding in a maze [[35](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib35)]. Taking this idea of microbial intelligence without consciousness a step further, it's possible to conceive a “microbial SETI”. This hypothetical intelligent bacteriosphere could “read the electromagnetic spectrum emitted from space”, “process the information” and communicate by “eject[ing] microbes into space” [[34](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib34)].[6](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn6)

But is this the type of intelligence we are searching for ? Because definitions of “intelligence are slippery” [[36](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib36)], the acronym SETI was perhaps not the best way to name this endeavor. As noted by Dick, “the SETI community largely consists of radio-astronomers not experts on the nature and evolution of intelligence” [[37](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib37)]. In addition to being non-binary and multidimensional, the problem with intelligence is that it’s directly undetectable [[38](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib38)]. Only the consequences of its actions, i.e. mostly technosignatures, can be observed [[38](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib38)]. The SETI project could thus be reframed as the “theory and practice of searching for extraterrestrial technology or technosignatures” [[36](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib36)]. Therefore, by “intelligent” we should understand “able to develop detectable technology”. This definition leads to a more reductive approach to SETI, as it implies leaving out biosignatures (signs or by-products of metabolism, providing evidence of past or present life [[36](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib36)]). However, biosignatures might be way more frequent than technosignatures, as there are good reasons to suspect that intelligent life is rare [[39](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib39)].

This narrower interpretation of intelligence implies that a certain degree of complexity is expected in the brain-like information processing apparatus of ETIs. It is because of this complexity that a model for controlling attention is needed, the result of which is subjective experience.

## 4. Phenomenality in a post-biological setting

### 4.1. The post-biological universe

So far, I've only considered p-consciousness in the context of biological evolution and concluded that a biological ETI would most likely experience phenomenality. However, many authors have argued that if we make contact with an ETI, it statistically won't be with a biologic entity, but with a post-biological one [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10),[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)]. This is why I will now attempt to extend the illusionist conceptions of p-consciousness to a post-biological setting.

Life enters the post-biological realm when it “has evolved beyond flesh and blood to artificial intelligence” [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)]. By extension, a post-biological universe is one where artificial intelligence (AI) is the predominant intelligence [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10),[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40),[41](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib41)].

Accepting the plausibility of a post-biological universe, i.e., that the natural trajectory of intelligent biological life is to evolve towards AI, requires at least two reasonable assumptions. The first is that intelligence, at least to a sufficient degree, leads to culture (defined as a set of learned behaviors passed down through generations) [[37](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib37)].[7](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn7) The second is that at some point, cultural evolution supersedes biological evolution [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)].

Our understanding of cultural evolution is embryonic, although it might bear similarities with biological Darwinian evolution (possibly including a quasi-Spencerian or a quasi-Lamarckian component)[8](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn8) [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40),[41](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib41)]. Dick nevertheless considers that “the maintenance, improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence is the central driving force of cultural evolution, and that to the extent intelligence can be improved, it will be improved” [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)]. This is what he calls the “intelligence principle”.

Following this principle, we must admit that general AI (capable of at least equaling organic brains in a wide variety of tasks), if technically feasible, will be developed by all intelligent biological life forms. Once developed, according to the singularity hypothesis, this general AI will enter a recursive self-improvement regime, leading to the emergence of a super-intelligent AI (super-AI). This entity is defined as an “intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest” [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42)].

The subsequent replacement of biological intelligence by super AI doesn't _necessarily_ have to be confrontational. Silicon is a medium with undeniable advantages over carbon (and other hypothetical biochemistries), as it allows faster information processing, survival under extreme conditions and quasi-immortality [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10)]. Moreover, it allows collective thinking and is incredibly modular. Biological organisms could thus be encouraged to turn to silicon to escape their biological limitations, either by downloading the mind or by intelligence amplification processes [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10),[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)].[9](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn9)

The claim that we're living in a post-biological universe is supported by what is known as the “short window argument”. It argues, admittedly on an anthropocentric basis, that once a civilization creates technology, it is only a few hundred years away from the post-biological transition [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10)]. This figure should be compared to the theoretical median age of ETI which has been estimated at several billion years on the basis of cosmological models (to determine the median age of Earth-like planets) and our knowledge on the apparition and evolution of life (chiefly the rapid origination of life on early earth) [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10),[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40),[41](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib41)]. Of course we have to assume here that, contrary to some proposed explanations to the FP, ETI survive for just as long [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)].

A super-AI is probably almost as inapprehensible to us as we are to rodents. Nevertheless, Bostrom argues that a super-AI is very likely to pursue some instrumental goals, as their attainment would increase the chances of realizing a wide range of final goals in a wide range of situations (the instrumental convergence thesis) [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42)]. These goals include self-preservation, goal-content integrity, cognitive enhancement, technological perfection and resource acquisition [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42)]. It should be noted that cognitive improvement and technological perfection imply super-AI's self-improvement.

Extending the debate on artificial consciousness, other authors have written not about the goals of the super-Ais that we might develop and/or encounter, but about their hypothetical status with respect to p-consciousness [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10),[43](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib43)]. Referring to the "hard problem of consciousness”, Schneider called this question the "hard problem of extraterrestrial superintelligence” and noted that it doesn't escape the traditional problem of other minds [[10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib10)].

There is a large range of possible answers, from skepticism through agnosticism to optimism, each overarched by various broader positions in the philosophy of mind [[43](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib43)]. Illusionism, as one of these positions, naturally has its place in the debate.

### 4.2. Post-biological derivation of illusionism and AST

Illusionism, because it doesn't regard p-consciousness as a separate kind of mental feature, has no objection to a machine (including a super-AI) claiming to experience phenomenality. In particular, the “hard problem of extraterrestrial super-intelligence” can be analyzed through the prism of AST.

Because it's a mechanistic theory of p-consciousness, AST implies that an AI can perfectly well claim to have a subjective experience, just as we do as biological “robots” [[20](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib20)]. Furthermore, AST provides guidelines for implementing p-consciousness in a machine [[20](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib20)]. Graziano even stressed the need to design phenomenally conscious machines. He argues that, given the social dimension of the attention schema, this would not only enhance their ability to interact with people but also provide a safeguard against the potential danger they pose to mankind [[20](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib20)].

P-consciousness emerged as an adaptive response in the course of biological evolution. Just because artificial consciousness is possible does not mean that p-consciousness necessarily persists in a post-biological context.

The attention control model that underlies p-consciousness in organic life is primarily a response to the constraint of limited information-processing capacity. I've already noted that silicon is a better medium for information processing than organic matter. In fact, the peak speed of neurons is seven order of magnitude slower than current micro-processors. Axons carry action potentials at a speed of 120 m/s whereas machines can convey information at the speed of light. This of course creates a limit to the size and therefore to the number of computing elements in an organic brain, while machines could theoretically grow to planetary size [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42)]. Add to this the unprecedented ability of machines to think collectively and the computing power of a super-AI seems incommensurable.

However, as long as super-AIs have specific goals, there still seems to be an advantage in using computing resources efficiently, no matter how colossal they may be. Therefore, the utility of an internal control model of attention to prioritize some signals makes sense in a post-biological context.

Cognitive improvement and technological perfection, which imply self-improvement, are among the instrumental goals of super-AI. Therefore, since the super-AI is in a perspective of constant self-improvement, it doesn't matter whether or not p-consciousness has been embedded at some point in its development. The relevant question is rather whether phenomenal consciousness can emerge and above all endure (because of its beneficial nature) during the evolution of the super-AI.

Emerging properties have already been noticed for instance in self-supervised large language models(LLM) [[44](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib44),[45](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib45)]. Since it has been argued that LLMs develop internal models of the world, an internal model of the self is fully conceivable. Subsequently, a representation of the awareness relation between this model of the self and a piece of information (such as a model of an object in the external world) also becomes perfectly plausible. Actually, the future emergence of consciousness in extended LLMs is already widely discussed. Chalmers suggests that “on mainstream assumptions, it's reasonable to have a significant credence that we'll have conscious [extended LLMs] within a dec ade” [[46](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib46)][10](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn10).

The emergence of p-consciousness in AI is therefore credible and, as its advantages have already been described in a post-biological context, so is its persistence. I'd like to add that if we believe that embodiment is a prerequisite for general AI [[47](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib47)], or that being self-standing in the environment is a necessary criterion to progress from AI to super-AI [[43](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib43)], then we have another argument for the usefulness of an attention schema. The schema's social dimension is obviously of great help if an embodied AI is to interact with its environment.

Looking at p-consciousness in this way has an interesting outcome. Its evolutionary history shows us that it comes by degrees. Also, it has already been stated that models of attention control (and therefore self-awareness) are present in species with radically different information processing capacities. If we expect a super-AI to experience phenomenality, we must also consider that the degree of its p-consciousness is different, and that it is potentially “super-conscious”.

P-consciousness is to us an incomplete picture, a cartoon-like representation of the attentional process of selecting and enhancing both external and internal inputs [[22](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib22)]. The attention process in the hardware of a super-AI would be extraordinarily more complex than that in our brains, because the quantity of signals would be of a completely different order of magnitude. Thus, in roughly the same proportion, the model of attention would also be much more detailed, this time like a photograph. Depending on that proportion, the strength of the illusion could also be different. Given the illusion's epistemic impact and the super-AI's ability to redesign itself, there's a good chance that the illusion would be weaker.

Super-consciousness has already been discussed by some authors. Torrance also puts forward the idea that super-consciousness could differ qualitatively from human subjective experience, in the same way that our experience differs from that of a rodent [[43](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib43)]. Arrabales, who also postulates on the basis of ethology and phylogeny that consciousness is gradual, sees super-consciousness as the ability to have “several streams of consciousness in oneself” [[48](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib48)]. However, his underlying theory of consciousness, although functionalist, differs from AST. This idea of multiple streams of consciousness could be consistent with a decentralized parallel architecture of the super-AI. In this case, we could also imagine a control model for these different streams, which could be described as a "meta-consciousness".

Returning to the search for ETI, this derivation of AST in a post-biological context, has the consequence that if super-AIs are indeed the most common intelligent entities in the Universe, we should again expect the entity we try to contact to have a phenomenal experience. However, this experience would be different from ours, and our interlocutor would probably be “super-conscious”. In this case, it's not certain that the aforementioned common ground in phenomenality still holds.

## 5. The normative challenge of illusionism and Fermi paradox

It would be hard to write a paper on the SETI and the FP without mentioning the Drake equation, which estimates the number of communicative ETI in the galaxy. Actually, the parameters of this equation can be split into three groups: astronomical (relating to formation of planetary systems), biological (relating to the emergence of life) and cultural (relating to intelligent life). These cultural parameters are fc (the fraction of planets with intelligent life developing a technological civilization) and L (the lifetime of a technological civilization, i.e. the time interval during which it emits detectable signal into space[11](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn11)) [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)].

If L is short, around 102 years, then we're probably living in a biological universe. Conversely, if L is long, exceeding 103 years, then it's very likely we're part of a post-biological universe [[40](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib40)]. These values are inferred from the anthropocentric observation that, given the tremendous pace at which we're making progress in AI, we seem to be on the verge of entering the post-biological realm. In fact, as many proponents of the singularity have argued, it may only be a few decades before we develop strong AI.

Besides determining the dominant type of intelligence in the Universe, the value of L is an important element in discussions on the FP. A low value of L might explain why we have not detected any ETI so far. Actually, if L is below 102–103 years, then an ETI remains detectable by its technosignatures only for a short period. Numerous “neocatastrophic” scenarios have been proposed to account for a low value of L, such as ecological holocaust and nuclear self-destruction [[2](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib2)].

Also, many authors have warned of the existential risks posed by AI, arguing that the advent of general AI could be the “great filter” on the way to colonizing the galaxy [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42),[49](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib49)]. AI could be involved in a variety of catastrophic scenarios, for instance when used by states or organization to create lethal autonomous weapons, engineer pathogens or conduct cyberwarfare [[50](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib50)].

In the previous section, super-AI was described as a totally inapprehensible entity, vastly surpassing our cognitive performances in all domain and pursuing some (instrumental and final) goals. Because of its inapprehensible nature, the final goals of super-AI may be totally enigmatic for us, while the instrumental goals (in particular resource acquisition) are worrying. Therefore, the most fundamental threat posed by AI is misalignment (an AI is aligned when it behaves in accordance with human intentions and values, and by extension, on a cosmic scale, with those of its organic developers).

Misalignment can occur in any AI (and has already been observed in current AI systems), but the associated risks increase with the capabilities of AI (reaching catastrophic level with an advanced general AI, and turning into an existential threat in the case of super-AI) [[51](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib51)].

So far, I have mainly focused on the AST to make predictions about the experience of phenomenality in biological and post-biological ETI. I will now show that illusionism, as a broader philosophical position, contains the germ of a neocatastrophic scenario involving AI misalignment and can therefore participate in the debate on the FP.

It is a widely accepted thesis that phenomenality grounds value. Assuming that phenomenality does not exist but only seems to exist, has profound revisionary consequences. This has been called the “normative challenge” of illusionism [[52](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib52)].

It could be considered _prima facie_ that denying the existence of phenomenal states leads to pure nihilism. If there is no other way to ground value, then the whole Universe is totally indifferent. It could be regarded as devoid of any situation that we intuitively consider “good” or “bad” (including of course war, totalitarianism and genocide) [[52](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib52)]. This has been grasped by opponents of illusionism, such as Strawson who wrote “If [Dennett is] right, no one has ever really suffered, in spite of agonizing diseases, mental illness, murder, rape, famine, slavery, bereavement, torture, and genocide. And no one has ever caused anyone else pain […]. We must hope that [this idea] doesn't spread outside the academy or convince some future information technologist or roboticist who has great power over our lives” [[53](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib53)].

I don't think that normative nihilism or skepticism is a real threat for human society. Nihilism and radical skepticism already have a long philosophical history. Moreover, endorsing a “strong” physicalism, already fundamentally shakes up the field of ethics, because accepting hard determinism (and incompatibilism) challenges our conception of free will. The position that there is no free will is much more widespread among scientists, philosophers and society in general than illusionism. Yet it has no normative implications in our societies.

Human beings are “intuitively phenomenal realists” because of the strength of the illusion [[52](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib52)]. Even if we firmly believe that phenomenality shouldn't be regarded as a “magic bullet” to ground value, and even if we can provide arguments to that effect (for instance the arguments from indeterminacy and from justification) [[54](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib54)],[12](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn12) we cannot reprogram our attention schema to soften the illusion. Therefore, instead of falling into nihilism, even as convinced illusionists, we're attracted by “moderate and conservative options” [[52](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib52)] regarding phenomenality and value.

A non-aligned advanced general AI would almost certainly be a nihilistic sociopath by our standards. It would pursue its objectives, potentially as seemingly absurd as “maximizing the total number of paperclips in the Universe”, or “solving the Riemann hypothesis” [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42)]. This pursuit is likely to involve intermediate instrumental objectives, such as the acquisition of resources, which could easily involve the enslavement of humanity (if it is a useful resource) or its destruction (if it is a waste of resources).

I can accept that some form of morality might spontaneously emerge from such AI. However, I would be very surprised, if illusionism is true, that it aligns with our most widely held normative ethical positions. Possessing not only intellectual capacities superior to ours, but also the ability to redesign itself, such an AI would perhaps be super-conscious, but would probably not succumb to phenomenal realism as we do (especially as it is not certain that the force of illusion would be as great in such a system). Moreover, since it surpasses us in all areas including moral philosophy, an advanced AI could develop an ethics that is not based on phenomenality. If phenomenality does not exist and therefore has no value, then the suffering of humanity will not matter to a non-aligned AI seeking to achieve its goals.

However, AI researchers are acutely aware of the critical need to align AI with our intentions and values. The problem of alignment (the task of ensuring AI alignment) is a combination of a normative challenge and a technical challenge [[55](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib55)]. The technical part corresponds to the formal encoding of values in the artificial agent while the normative part asks what values ought to be encoded [[55](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib55)].

This normative challenge is dauntingly complex. Values inherently possess a strong degree of abstraction and uncertainty.[13](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#fn13) They lack universality as they are constantly evolving at the level of the individual, states and societies [[51](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib51),[55](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib55)]. Therefore, it's a tricky question to find a set of values to encode so that the AI behaves in accordance with our intentions. Given that humans are intuitively phenomenal realists, this set of values, which must be accepted by a large majority of the population, will certainly be rather vague and grounded in phenomenality. As a result, it will seem hardly acceptable for an advanced AI which, for the reasons explained above, wouldn't be phenomenally realist. The illusionist rejection of the intuitive link between phenomenality and value makes alignment even more difficult. It's worth pointing out that if a misaligned super-AI represents an existential threat to humanity, we may only have one chance to choose a set of values and encode it correctly.

Misalignment could occur at any point of AI's development. I mentioned earlier that the risks posed by misalignment are less at an early stage. However, if the “procedure [of alignment is delayed] until the agent is superintelligent, it may be able to resist our attempt to meddle with its motivation system” [[42](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib42)].

In the case of a violent confrontation, we expect a super-AI to have a decisive advantage and survive us (and this is a special case of transition from a biological to post-biological life). However, a misaligned advanced general AI that might not be totally self-standing yet, could indeed lead to planetary catastrophe and the extinction of technological life.

Throughout this paper, I have adopted a rather universalist stances positions, concerning the transposability of the rules of biological evolution as we know it, the emergence of p-consciousness elsewhere than on Earth, and the development of AI as a consequence of cultural evolution. Although it might be an anthropocentric claim (N = 1 reasoning), this AI misalignment problem underpinned by the normative problem of illusionism could also be universal. Therefore, it should be a candidate for a neo-catastrophic explanation to the FP.

I'm aware that this explanation doesn't meet Ćirković's principle of non-exclusivity, which states that we should prefer explanations to the FP involving a small number of local causes [[2](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib2)]. But this is the case with most of the neocatastrophists' scenarios, such as mass extinction due to gamma-ray explosions and the self-destruction of civilization by nuclear holocaust. This paragraph might seem a bit anthropocentric, but we have to remember that the search for ETI is also a mirror on ourselves and our future [[49](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib49)].

I would just like to note that the ethical challenges raised by illusionism in the context of AI development go far beyond the normative problem but are outside the scope of this paper. Since we've supported the idea of AI possessing p-consciousness, we need to ask ourselves about the moral implications of developing an entity that can experience suffering. Also, the mechanistic conception of p-consciousness supported by AST paves the way for a malicious AI to simulate conscious entities, with all the unpleasant situations one can imagine [[38](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bib38)].

## 6. Conclusion

AST explains the nature and the origin of p-consciousness: an introspective illusion arising from an internal control model of attention (the attention schema). In addition, this theory allows p-consciousness to be placed within the framework of biological evolution. The evolutionary history of p-consciousness highlights not only its gradual nature, but also the wide distribution of its causal mechanisms among living organisms on Earth.

The attention schema is an adaptive response to the constraint of organisms' limited information-processing capacities. This schema optimizes information processing, and the advantage of being endowed with it probably increases with the complexity of the nervous system. Through its social dimension, it also enables cooperation and the attribution of intention to other agents, which also improves fitness.

We have very good reason to believe that extraterrestrial biological life is also shaped by evolution, and in particular by natural selection. The constraint to which the attention pattern responds is clearly also ubiquitous. Through convergent evolution, it is reasonable to expect that ETIs which have developed a technology will be endowed with the illusion of p-consciousness. However, their subjective experience may differ qualitatively from ours.

Furthermore, AST can be placed in a post-biological universe where, according to the "intelligence principle” that governs cultural evolution, super-intelligent AIs (super-AI) are the dominant form of intelligence. Because AST is a mechanistic theory of p-consciousness, it not only asserts that machine consciousness is theoretically achievable, but also proposes guidelines for its implementation in AI. Given that the benefits of the attention schema persist in a post-biological context, such a model could also perfectly emerge spontaneously during the evolution of AI. It's likely then that super-AIs also experience phenomenality and might actually even be "super-conscious".

Finally, by denying the existence of phenomenal states, illusionism, as a broader philosophical position, challenges the widely accepted thesis that phenomenality grounds value. Although this could theoretically lead to a form of normative nihilism, the strength of the illusion of subjective experience keeps humans intuitively phenomenally realist. However, an advanced AI, surpassing human cognition in all areas, including moral philosophy, would be capable of developing an ethics that would not be based on phenomenality. Our values, grounded in a non-existent phenomenality, would appear poorly justified for such an AI, which increases the risk of AI misalignment. Therefore, illusionism gives credit to neocatastrophist scenarios involving misaligned AI which could explain the Fermi paradox as this challenge might also be widespread.

They have been characterized as ineffable, intrinsic, private and immediately apprehended, inaccessible to third-person science, and therefore seems inexplicable in physical terms.

In my opinion, one of the strongest elements in favor of illusionism is that it can act as a 'debunking argument'. Indeed, illusionism explains our belief that p-consciousness is abnormal from a physicalist point of view, without referring to that belief. I'd also like to note that illusionism has the advantage of accounting for our dualistic intuitions without having to reframe physicalism. Furthermore, this explanatory power does not come at the expense of simplicity, since all it takes is a few thought experiments to grasp the main principles of the theory.

Graziano stated that he “[doesn't] mind if people call AST an illusionist theory”. However, he regards the word 'illusionism' as dismissive, whereas AST emphasizes the usefulness of p-consciousness.

We might even suggest that p-consciousness has appeared several times on Earth, if we consider that it’s to some extent present in cephalopods.

And it should be remembered that, as in addition to optimizing the use of computing resources, the attention scheme also enables cooperation through its social dimension.

Another more commonplace example of intelligence without consciousness is the collective intelligence demonstrated by social insects.

This is partly supported by the work of ethologists who have highlighted the existence of culture in non-human primates and cetaceans.

Lamarck supported the idea that traits acquired during an organism's lifetime can be inherited by its offspring. Spencer, for his part, defended a teleological and universal conception of evolution, as a progression (of species, the human mind and societies) from the simple to the complex, and from lower to higher forms.

In addition to the recursive self-improvement regime, other scenarios lead to the emergence of a super-AI. For instance, because of the properties of silicon, an “uploaded brain” could think much faster than its organic original, but also connect with its peers, and in the end give rise to a super-AI.

So, while the scenario of recursive improvement seems to me the most likely, it is not the only one that can be envisaged. But that doesn't really change the point. The emergence of a non-biological super-intelligence, in whatever form, remains the logical consequence of cultural evolution. Similarly, whatever path it takes to emerge, the characteristics of the super-AI remain inapprehensible to humans.

Chalmers understands here the term consciousness as “subjective experience”.

[11](https://omnivore.app/secretlyjoseph/phenomenal-consciousness-is-alien-to-us-seti-and-the-fermi-parad-192ab9f6928#bfn11)

This definition is contestable because ETI could decide to remain hidden (“dark forest hypothesis”) or could simply cease to be detectable (as the post-postbiological civilizations described by Ćirković).

The value of phenomenal states (such as pain) seems indisputable through introspection. However, since our grasp of p-consciousness is illusory, introspection's conclusions about phenomenality cannot be trusted. This is the “justification argument” for rejecting phenomenality as a “magic bullet” to ground value. Also, because p-consciousness is gradual, there are some cases whether the status of an agent regarding phenomenality is indeterminate. This prevents once again the use of phenomenally as a basis for value (“indeterminacy argument”).

Illusionism which is an eliminativism about qualia is associated with the broader philosophical movement of eliminative materialism. The thesis of eliminative materialism is that most concepts of our common “folk psychology” (consciousness, beliefs, moral values …) are empty and do not stand for anything in objective reality.
